# eSPGAN

We use SPGAN and eSPGAN as baselines for [4th visda challenge](http://ai.bu.edu/visda-2020). We will release all the codes and datasets when challenges begins.

We extend the SPGAN (our prior work in CVPR2018) to an end-to-end version, named eSPGAN.

Here, we provide the pytorch version of SPGAN. Please try this code. This code is based on https://github.com/LynnHo/CycleGAN-Tensorflow-2, thanks for their project.

Recently, my friend [Xiao](http://xiaoxiaosun.com/) conducted experiment on the Synthetic data [PersonX](https://github.com/sxzrt/Instructions-of-the-PersonX-dataset), and she found that SPGAN is helpful. Specifically, Synthetic-->Market result is almost 52% in rank-1 accuracy! 

Now, she is doing experiment with eSPGAN. We are working closely to study the domain adpatation problem in person re-identification.

Thanks for your attention!
