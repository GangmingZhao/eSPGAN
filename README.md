# eSPGAN
We extend the SPGAN (our prior work in CVPR2018) to an end-to-end version, named eSPGAN.

Here, we provide the pytorch version of SPGAN. Please try this code. This code is based on https://github.com/LynnHo/CycleGAN-Tensorflow-2, thanks for this project.

Thanks for your attention.

(By the way, I haven't used this code for a year. Thus, if you meet any question, please contact me, thanks!)
